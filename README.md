# Tic-Tac-Toe_React-Native

This is the react-native version of the tic-tac-toe game. I has been built for the `expo` emulator. Initiate a terminal in the folder and `npm install expo-cli -g`. 
When its done execute 'expo start'. Expo will show you a qr code on the terminal. Download the Expo app form the play/app store and scan it. It will open the game.

Upgrades to be done: Hook implementation & Interactive CSS for web/desktop
